# Fabrication of nanoelectronic devices - Group 14 

This repo contains the runsheet and the final report.
Both are typeset using LaTeX.

Questions while reading the script:
1. $`\dot L`$ in eqtn. (23) -> probably typo; Factor 10 missing in the following eqtn.
2. one 2 missing in (15) (spin degeneration)
3. "steepest  inverse  subthreshold  slope" for shortest gate length?? I think the opposite is meant? p. 19 
4. $`\Phi_{SB} \greq 4-5\times k_BT`$ -> unit of 4?? eV?
